About
=====

The gognuflag library provides a programmatically similar interface
to the built-in 'flag' package, except the flag and command-line semantics
are identical to those of GNU getopt_long().

Building
========

Just run 'make'.

Licensing
=========

Currently, gognuflag is released under a GPLv3+ license. If this would be
more useful to you under another license, drop me an email; I am
willing to consider relicensing.
